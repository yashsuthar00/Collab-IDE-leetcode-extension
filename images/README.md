# Icon Files for LeetCode to Collab IDE Extension

This directory contains the icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 icon for the extension toolbar
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 icon for the extension management page
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 icon for the Chrome Web Store and installation

You should create or download these icons in the appropriate sizes to complete the extension.

## Icon Design Guidelines

- Use a simple, recognizable design that represents the Collab IDE and LeetCode integration
- The design should be recognizable even at the smallest size (16x16)
- Use the same color scheme as your Collab IDE application for brand consistency

## How to Generate Icons

You can use the included `generate-icons.html` file to create all required icon sizes from a single source image.
